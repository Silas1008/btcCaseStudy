    <h3>Background</h3>
    <h2>Know them and the issues they face </h2>
    <p>Communities served by "Be the Change" often grapple with various issues, including educational <br></br>disparities, emotional distress, and a lack of supportive networks. The organization recognized <br></br>the need for a holistic approach to uplift these communities, acknowledging the interconnected <br></br>nature of challenges faced by individuals, particularly children and women.</p>
    <h2 style={{ color: 'rgb(14, 37, 150)' }}>The Children</h2>
    <p>In today's world, children continue to face multifaceted challenges both at home and in schools.<br></br> The historical context of societal structures and family dynamics has left a lasting impact. Many <br></br>children experience a lack of emotional support, stemming from issues in the family, such as <br></br>economic hardships, domestic instability, and societal stigmas. This absence of a nurturing <br></br>environment affects their upbringing, leaving them in search of acceptance and love. At schools,<br></br> educational disparities, bullying, and peer pressure compound these challenges. The <br></br>interconnected issues of inadequate emotional support and familial struggles underscore the need<br></br> for comprehensive efforts to create supportive environments, addressing both educational and <br></br>emotional needs of children.</p>

    <h2 style={{ color: 'rgb(14, 37, 150)' }}>The women</h2>
    <p>Impoverished women in certain regions still face profound barriers to education and societal <br></br>support. Despite global progress, the economically disadvantaged are disproportionately affected, <br></br>with limited access to educational opportunities. Discriminatory practices, coupled with <br></br>insufficient societal support, perpetuate a cycle of exclusion. Women in these communities often<br></br> lack the resources and encouragement needed to pursue education, hindering personal <br></br>development and perpetuating gender disparities. Addressing these challenges requires <br></br>comprehensive efforts to dismantle societal barriers, enhance educational accessibility, and foster <br></br>a supportive environment that empowers women in marginalized communities.</p>
